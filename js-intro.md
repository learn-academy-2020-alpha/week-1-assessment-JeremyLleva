# ASSESSMENT 1: INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT
## Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer: Test driven development, TDD consists of incremental upgrades to the code base making sure to run new test every time to ensure a working product at all times.

  Researched answer: A code development cycle that involves creating test, ensuring those test past, and refactor the cocde



7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

 Your answer: Learning and understanding the git workflow and practicing the pushing and updating to master was helpful, also the introduction to code testing was nice and helped push me to dig deeper into learning code testing
